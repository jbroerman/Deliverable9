This means that our model is able to accurately predict 95 out of 100 times when a tumor is malignant. Additionally, the precision metric is able to be used to confirm false positives for our malignant tumors. Our model is very precise, and only around 4/100 tumors that are reported malignant aren't. A simple decision tree model like so is able to accurately identify tumors."
